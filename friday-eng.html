        <p>Fridays, as well as Mondays, <em class="bold">I am off university, so I go to work</em>.
          Just like every working morning, today, after 10, we have a morning meeting where everyone tells us about what they did yesterday and plans for today.
          At the end of this meeting, my colleagues and I go to <em> Rimi </em> where we each buy lunch.</p>

        <p>This Friday I have other important meetings at work that I need to attend. The first meeting is refinement,
          where we discuss next week's assignments and check for any errors in explaining the assignments. This meeting is for one hour,
          and after that I have a personal call with my work manager where we talked about my progress on the team - how do I go about meeting my goals,
          and how satisfied both me and him are with my current team situation. After finishing this hour long call,
          the remainder of my work day, I'm fulfilling my tasks for this week and helping my work colleague.</p>

        <h4>Fridays evening</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock3.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>Unfortunately, this Friday I work until eight in the evening. After finishing work, I immediately contacted my friends and agreed to go play billiards with them.
          Spending about two hours on the pool table with friends and drink one beer after a hard day's work, we say goodbye to each other and everyone goes to his or her place. At home I decided not to do anything productive and just relax for tomorrow.</p>
