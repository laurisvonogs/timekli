      <p>Welcome to my website, which was created for the required requirements of the Web Design Fundamentals course. Here I will tell you about <em>one week in my life as a LU DF student</em>. To better delve into my story this week, I'll tell you a little about myself.</p>
      <p>My name is Lauris Vonogs, I am studying in the 3rd year of the Faculty of Computer Science of the University of Latvia and I am trying to get a bachelor's degree. In addition to studying at LU, I work as a developer at Visma Labs, where I started working thanks to practice at LU. About my hoobie, most of the time I like to do all kinds of activities, especially sports. I try to exercise and improve myself in other areas also at least twice a week.</p>
      <p>I will not go into detail about myself, as the purpose of this site is to reflect my week, not the entire of my life. In the following sections, I will tell you about each day in the first full week of November, from November 4 to November 10, because I want to tell you about a week that is like a regular week.</p>
