        <p>Monday mornings are the hardest for me because I am used to studying on weekends after midnight and then having to get up early in the morning for work. On the positive side, on Mondays I don't have any lectures at LU,
          so I can concentrate all day on tasks for work. My morning routine starts with breakfast, brushing my teeth, browsing the latest news, and after that it's time to go to work.</p>

        <h4>Work tasks</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock2.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>I arrive at work at nine and spend the next hour doing the assignments that I have been given. At 10:15 begins the first working meeting where each of our team mebers tells us what he did on the previous day and what plans he has for today.
          At the end of the meeting, until 11:30, I continue to work on my own and then go to lunch with my colleagues. I have other meetings after lunch, or I keep working, and I leave work before 20:00.</p>

        <h4>Evening physical activity</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock3.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>After work, I have two options: if there is a football game this week for the team I play on, then I go do that, if not, I go to the gym and stay there until 23:00,
          after which I just go home. When I come home, looking at that this was a tiring day for me, I had dinner, even though it's night, browsed through my telephone, brushed my teeth and went to bed to sleep,
          to be energetically ready for tomorrow.</p>
