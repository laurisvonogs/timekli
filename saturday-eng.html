        <img src="./img/clock.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>Because I had not slept for at least 6 hours on any day of the week,
          today I allowed myself to sleep longer and woke up only after ten o'clock. When I woke up, I was of course still sleepy,
          and spent the first hour just sitting on the internet doing nothing productive.</p>

        <h4>Productive saturday</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock2.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>As the clock approached 12:00, I decided to find a quick snack in the fridge and start a new section on the <em> Thinking Systematics </em> course work.
          After spending less than an hour studying theory and then two hours writing my own work, I decided to take some time off from writing and go to the store to buy the products I needed,
          while resting my head in the fresh air. Coming back from the store, I prepare lunch for myself and after eating that,
          I finish the section on thinking systematics work, with which I finish this weeks homeworks.</p>

        <h4>Evening relaxation</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock3.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>This Saturday night, I decided to go with my friends to the <em> "Vecais Pēteris" cafe </em> next door. When we arrive at this cafe and order food,
          we started playing a variety of board games that were available to <em> "Vecais Pēteris" </em> clients. When food was brought to us, we put aside board games and started talking about a variety of topics.
          As soon as everyone eat their meals, we said goodbye and went to our home. Coming home, I decided to arrange my room and watch a good movie. After watching the movie, I went to bed.</p>
