        <p>Sundays for me are my favorite days because every Sunday I can spend more time relaxing,
          due to the fact that all the homework is done. On Sundays, I usually get up after ten o'clock and the first two hours, like yesterday, are spent reading news on the Internet.</p>

        <h4>Work studies</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock2.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>Since all my homework for the university is done, <em class="bold">I devote three hours om Sunday to improving my work knowledge</em>.
          This Sunday I started learning <em> Azure Databricks </em> and in what situations it is best to use it. After that, I started learning about
          how to make the most of <em> Azure </em> resources, and what resources in which situations are most effective. Mostly I watched videos,
          where someone talks about these topics or I read official documentation on the topics I studied.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <h4>End of the week</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock3.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>As I finish learning about <em> Azure </em> resources, I prepare dinner for myself. As I eat dinner, I start thinking about next week's plans -
          what will be my goals for next week, what I have to do, what I want to do and how much time I can devote to learning.
          Although this week was not one of the most interesting of which I could tell, in terms of productivity, I did more this week than in previous weeks.
          I hope next week will be at least as productive as this week, if not more productive, because the more time I spend on training now, the easier the end of the session will be.
