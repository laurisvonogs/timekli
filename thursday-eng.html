        <h4>Thursday morning</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>This morning is as heavy as yesterday, as today at 8:30 is a lecture on Web Design tutored by S.Zariņa.
          In this lecture we are taught the theory of what a website should look like and are showed the examples of what we should strive for.
          At the end of this lecture, the next lecture takes place in the <em> Formal Grammar </em> course, tutored by A. Šostaks.
          Here we are taught about a magazine machine that can later be used in various algorithms.</p>

        <h4>Lectures and work</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock2.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>As usual, I find free time today, to complete the necessary tasks. Since the next lecture is on databases,
          I spend a few moments on my work assignments. When this lecture ends, the next two hours are free,
          so I decide to go to <em> Daily </em>, which is in the basement of LU. After lunch, I spend the rest of my time doing the necessary tasks
          At 16:30, the C course lecture <em> Critical Thinking </em> begins, which is tutored T. Stepiņš. This is the only lecture that does not take place at the Faculty of Computer Science of the University of Latvia,
          so I have to go to the LU Philosophy Faculty, which fortunetaly is five minutes from my faculty. In this lecture, I learn about critical thinking styles and speaking theory,
          we try to find signs of conclusions in the examples given.</p>

        <h4>Late practical work</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock3.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>At the end of this lecture, I go back to the LU Faculty of Computer Science, where there will be practical work in Web Design today.
          Here I spend most of my time completing the fourth task. After I am finished with that, I go home. It's late,
          so nothing interesting happens. I usually spend the rest of the day relaxing and going to bed shortly before midnight because it was a difficult day for me.</p>
