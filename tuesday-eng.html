        <h4>First lecture of the week</h4>

        <p>On Tuesdays I can sleep longer due to the fact that the <em class="bold">first lecture of the week</em> starts only at 10:30. I usually get up at 8:30 on Tuesdays,
          to make my morning routine and learn a bit for today's lecture. Less than an hour before the lecture, I leave the dorm,
          in order to be on time for the <em> Mathematical Logic </em> lecture which is tutored by K. Podnieks.

        <h4>Back to work</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock2.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>At the end of the lecture, I go to the cafe <em> Daily </em> for lunch to keep me energized throughout the day. After lunch, I go to work,
          where I continue to work on my assignment, and additionally review the works of others and write down comments as needed.
          Like Monday, today I work up to almost eight, as the next two days will mostly be spent on the university stuff.
          On Wednesdays I take a full break from work and on Thursdays I work from school when I can.

      <div class="column">
        <h4>Tuesday evenings</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock3.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>Shortly before eight, I leave the workplace and head back to the dormitories. When returning to the dorm,
          I make dinner and then start doing homework for university. The first homework I do is for A.Å ostaks <em> Formal Grammar </em>
          test that is mandatory every week. Finally, I start doing homework which was from today's lecture.
          Due to its size, only half is done, so I leave it for another day. I follow my evening routine and then go to bed.</p>
