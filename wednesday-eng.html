        <h4>Early lecture</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>On Wednesdays I get up before seven, because at 8:30 there is a practice lecture in <em> Mathematical Analysis </em> which is tutored by I.Bule.
          In practice, we usually complete assignments that are related to the topics we learned in the lecture last week.
          At the end of the practical work, the next lecture continues with I.Bule, but in this lecture we continue to learn the theory of Mathematical Analysis.</p>

        <h4>Practical work and seminar</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock2.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>After the Mathematical Analysis lecture, the next one is the Database Practicum practical works led by D. Solodov≈Üikova.
          In these hands-on works, we get to know the topic of the day in the first half and in the second half we do the practical tasks that are related to the topic we learned.
          At the end of the class, we and my classmates go to <em> Lido </em> because we have to wait two hours for the next lecture.
          After renewing my energy, we go back to university and do homework on mathematical logic by the start of the seminar.
          At 16:30 the <em> Clean Code </em> seminar begins, where I get to know the biggest programming mistakes and what the best ways to write code are.</p>

        <h4>Gym and homework</h4>
        <img src="./img/clock3.png" alt="" class="clock">
        <p>Leaving the seminar, I immediately go to the gym, where I train my muscles, and also rest my mind from school and work.
          After spending a little more than an hour in the gym, I go back to the dorm. When I arrive at the dorm, I eat lunch and devote 20 minutes to the internet.
          Then I start doing homework for mathematical analysis, which took about two hours.
          After completing my homework, I spend about 30 minutes resting, which I usually spend on social networks. After the evening routine, I go to bed early so I can sleep.</p>
